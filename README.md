## Interview task

Australia is about to hold a referendum to enshrine an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice in the Australian Constitution. The referendum is expected to be held sometime in 2023. 

You have been given 10 working days and AUD 15,000 by a gambler who wants to know which way she should bet. Specifically, she wants to know the probabilities of this referendum succeeding or failing. She wants you to run some market research to find that out.

She does not allow any polling other than online survey sampling. So phone polling, street intercept, qualitative studies are now allowed.

## Questions to you:

1.	Please describe your approach.

2.	What sampling scheme would you use? Describe it in Excel in detail.

3.	What will your questionnaire be? Please write it out (maximum 10 questions)

4.	What issues relating to bias do you see there? How will you address them? Please discuss.

5.	How will you calculate the odds? Can you make a probability density plot? Explain your approach.
