## Interview task

An FMCG manufacturer is about to launch an advertising campaign for Voltage Paper, a new national brand of toilet paper in the USA. Voltage Paper is already sold across multiple channels nationwide. This will be the first advertising campaign for this brand.

They asked you to design a study to measure the effect of the campaign on awareness of the brand.

The client does not allow any polling other than online survey sampling. So phone polling, street intercept, qualitative studies are now allowed.

### Questions to you:

1. Please describe your approach.

2. How will you define the measure of effect of the campaign on the brand's awareness?

2. What sampling scheme would you use? Describe it in Excel in detail.

3. What will your questionnaire be? Please write it out (maximum 10 questions).

4. How will you calculate the effect? Explain your approach.
